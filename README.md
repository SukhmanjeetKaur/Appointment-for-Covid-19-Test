Abundance of Data where to store, how to create the panel where we can save, delete and
update the data. There’s come Database in picture. A database is a collection of data,
usually stored in electronic form. A database is typically designed so that it is easy to store
and access information. A good database is crucial to any company or organization. This is
because the database stores all the pertinent details about the company such as employee
records, transactional records, salary details etc. whatever that organization belongs too.
Current Pandemic (Coronavirus) has captured the whole planet with its deadly impact and
it’s difficult to store the data of each and every person suffering from this virus. So, here I
tried to make a program where we can easily get the data of the patients suffering from this
virus with help of database and python.

This project is all about Coronavirus Organization where I will be creating the data for
coronavirus suspected people. In this we will be scheduling appointments, admitting the
patient, corona tests and various there details. This project will be created with the help of
Python (Tkinter) and Database (sqlite3). This makes the job easier, data can be accessed
automatically just by typing the id details of the patient rather than doing it manually.

Outcomes

Easily accessible data
Storage of data
Updation of data
Secure way to keep the data
