# Appointment-for-Covid-19-Test
Abundance of Data where to store, how to create the panel where we can save, delete and
update the data. There’s come Database in picture. A database is a collection of data,
usually stored in electronic form. A database is typically designed so that it is easy to store
and access information. A good database is crucial to any company or organization. This is
because the database stores all the pertinent details about the company such as employee
records, transactional records, salary details etc. whatever that organization belongs too.
Current Pandemic (Coronavirus) has captured the whole planet with its deadly impact and
it’s difficult to store the data of each and every person suffering from this virus. So, here I
tried to make a program where we can easily get the data of the patients suffering from this
virus with help of database and python.

This project is all about Coronavirus Organization where I will be creating the data for
coronavirus suspected people registering themselves for Covid-19 Test. In this we will be scheduling appointments for corona tests and their details. This project will be created with the help of
Python (Tkinter) and Database (SQL). This makes the job easier, data can be accessed
automatically just by typing the id details of the patient rather than doing it manually.

Outcomes

Easily accessible data
Storage of data
Updation of data
Secure way to keep the data

Tkinter Programming

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −
• Import the Tkinter module.
• Create the GUI application main window.
• Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.
• Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

Pyttsx3 Module Pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

I will explain my project in detail with the help of screenshots of my project. 

This is the appointment screen where the detail of patients will be registered with the scheduling time of their Covid-19 Test.

You can see as I(Sukhmanjeet Kaur) has registered myself successfully as you can see the pop up stating Appointment for Sukhmanjeet Kaur has been created and it will be automatically stored in the Database and I show you in upcoming Screenshots.

Now when I clicked on OK, it will show Appointment fixed for Sukhmanjeet Kaur at 10:00

So, our first appointment has been successfully registered and we can see the total number of appointments also in the right side of the screen like how many appointments are there existing in the database.

Now I created three more registrations One for Drish, Second for Aditya and other for Sukhmani, I got the screenshot of Sukhmani's registration because further we will make changes so you can clearly see what the changes we have done in the data, that we will be doing later in upcoming shots.

Now you can clearly check all the four registrations are successfully registered in the Database.

Now, we can Search, Update and Delete the data of patients in the Database. That's why Database is the gift to us for minimizing our work that is done manually.
This is view you can see where we can search the patient's name and can perform the changes that is either we can update or delete the data.

Suppose we have searched for Sukhmani, as I told you earlier we will be doing changes in her data so i have already given her details in the above shots. Now you can correlate it with the searched data.

Now you can see the changes we have done in her data. We have changed her location from AMRITSAR to BENGALURU and changed her appointment timings from 12:00 to 15:00 and it successfully updated. Yipppee ... can feel the success.

Before celebrating, let's check whether it is updated in the Database or Not. Yes, Well Done! It got successfully updated in the database.
